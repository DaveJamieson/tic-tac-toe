Create a game of Tic Tac Toe. Two players take turns clicking somewhere to place an X or an O.
Any player that gets three of the same symbol in a row or diagonally, wins.

For the core challenge, you have 60 minutes. Here are the rules for this challenge:

Rule 1:
You _must_ spend at least the first 10 minutes on a whiteboard talking about:

- how to define the states
- how to detect a winning state
- which events to monitor
- the interface components layout
- the colors
- the headline
- which symbols to use for X and O (e.g. ðŸ˜œ and ðŸ¥Œ)
- the deployment
- which tasks you must do, who does what, and which order you will do them in

Rule 2:
You _must_ bring a repository online that both of you can access and push to.
You can choose to pair program on one machine, or split up, or do both.

Rule 3:
You _must_ bring the game online immediately, e.g. using Netlify. Even if it's
just a blank Vite app with a headline that reads "Tic Tac Toe".

## Let's go
First, create the base game - requirements below. You have 60 minutes.

Then, create an extended version - requirements below. You can take the rest of the day.

**Good luck!**

## Requirements (base game, 60 min)
- Draw a grid to play on, with 9 fields
- Click a field to set an X or an O, depending on which player you are
- Prompt the user to show whose turn it is
- Display who won as soon as somebody won

## Requirements (extended version, no time limit)
- Have a 'play again' button to play again
- Have a 'reset' button to reset the game
- Allow other symbols / random symbols
- Make it look _great_: colors, headline
- Make it _your own_: add a copyright notice, add _something personal_ - a wording,
  a headline, anything. Keep it more or less PG.
